Objective: The goal of this project is to create a product page for an e-commerce website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The page displays details about a specific product fetched from an API, allows users to select color and size variants, choose a quantity, and add the product to their cart.
Technologies Used:
HTML: Used for structuring the content of the webpage.
CSS: Used for styling the webpage to make it visually appealing and responsive.
JavaScript: Used for dynamic interactions such as fetching data from the API, updating the UI based on user actions, and handling cart functionality.
API Integration:
The project fetches product details from a provided API endpoint using JavaScript's fetch API.
Upon receiving the JSON response, it extracts relevant information such as product title, description, price, images, color options, and size options.
User Interface:
The webpage is designed to be visually appealing and responsive across different devices (desktop, tablet, mobile) using CSS media queries.
The product image and thumbnail images allow users to view different angles of the product.
Color options are presented as clickable blocks, allowing users to visually select their preferred color.
Size options are presented as radio buttons, enabling users to select their desired size.
Quantity can be adjusted using the +/- buttons or manually inputting the quantity.
Add to Cart Functionality:
Users can add the selected product to their cart by clicking the "Add to Cart" button.
Upon clicking, the selected color, size, quantity, and product details are collected, and a message confirming the addition to the cart is displayed below the button.
Dynamic Updates:
The webpage dynamically updates based on user interactions, such as selecting a different color or size.
The main product image changes to reflect the selected color variant.
The selected color is highlighted, and only one size option can be selected at a time.
Accessibility and Usability:
The webpage is designed with accessibility in mind, ensuring that users with disabilities can navigate and interact with the content effectively.
Clear labels, intuitive UI elements, and responsive design contribute to a user-friendly experience.
